## Introduction
The Vallendia Arena plugin represents an extensive project developed for the Vallendia community's Minecraft server. With over 100+ players, this plugin transformed the server's gameplay, introducing RPG classes, abilities, spells, parties, PvP, PvE, and tons of other unique features such as custom explosions and regenerating terrain. This intricate plugin provided a custom experience far beyond vanilla Minecraft, creating a dynamic and engaging environment for the Vallendia community.

## Features
### Custom Gameplay
- Redefine Minecraft with class-based PvPvE gameplay, unique abilities, and specialized parties (teams).
- Over 150 custom-made abilities with unique effects and synergies that can drastically alter gameplay.
- Abilities cover a wide spectrum of types, including Offensive, Defensive, Utility, and Passive, empowering players to strategize and create dynamic playstyles.

### Custom Ability API
- Develop new abilities easily with the powerful ability API.
- Acts as a backbone for easy creation and modification of abilities.
- Even users with limited coding knowledge can design new abilities and tweak game mechanics, fostering creativity within the Vallendia community.

### In-Game Progression
- Earn points through PvP and PvE to unlock abilities and upgrade stats.
- The in-game progression is based on a meticulously designed point-based system, carefully crafted with various mathematical variables to offer finely tuned progression akin to many MMO RPGs. The allocation of points has been thoughtfully considered, accounting for different factors such as the type of enemy defeated, player actions, and more.
- As you accumulate points, you can invest them in unlocking new abilities and upgrading your character's stats. The weighting of each ability or upgrade, determined by us, influences your character's level progression. In this game mode, levels serve as an indicator of your character's power level. The more abilities and upgrades you acquire, the higher your level will rise.
- This dynamic relationship between points, abilities, upgrades, and levels plays a pivotal role in determining the points you earn from defeating enemies, contributing to a balanced and engaging gameplay experience.

### Explosive Terrain & Regeneration
- Enjoy destructible terrain with custom explosions, adding depth and tactical possibilities.
- Terrain regenerates over time, enhancing the dynamic environment.

### Spawn System
- Navigate the game map through a custom spawn system that teleports players to various locations.
- Empowers server administrators to create multiple spawn points on the map.
- Players can traverse through a specific portal, which teleports them to a **random** spawn point from the list.
- Ensures a balanced gameplay experience by implementing contingencies to prevent players from spawning too close to each other, maintaining fairness in the PvP environment.

### And Loads More!
These listed features represent just a glimpse of what Vallendia Arena has to offer. As the backbone of our Minecraft server, this plugin is packed with an array of functionalities and innovations that reshape the Minecraft experience into something extraordinary. Whether you're delving into the intricate mechanics of custom abilities, engaging in explosive terrain battles, or strategizing with your team, Vallendia Arena provides a rich and engaging gameplay environment that continues to surprise and challenge players.
